We introduce you to a revolutionary neighborhood watch application that will unite citizens of neighborhoods throughout the country. Street sync sets up individual neighborhoods as separate groups as an emergency response system for that neighborhood. It is a communication tool for citizens interested in the safety and security of their neighborhood. Messages can be sent through email, SMS or a voice message to a home phone. This includes neighbors communicating general needs and concerns as a discussion that may not be critical to the safety of the neighborhood. 

Main features and content included are alerts for break ins, earthquakes, fires and other emergency related items. Additional features include live video feed from a neighborhood camera, garage sales and information on neighbors having special needs such as medical problems. Ancillary to this would be a neighborhood calendar of events, discussion board and an announcement board. At the time of an emergency or upon noticing suscpicious activity an individual can initiate an alert message to be sent to the group through the application. Then, after the issue is resolved or called off, a follow up message would be sent.

            <p>
              This project will require organizing the features of the neighborhood watch application into user stories. It will require iterative development of these user stories in order to create the neighborhood watch application.

            <p>
            This will provide a solution to enable neighbors to be aware of safety and security concerns in their neighborhood. It will also provide a useful project for the course CSIS 2450 to allow my group to get a grade and pass this course.
